          <h2 class="sub_title"><span class="yellow">Online Rummy</span> <span class="black">  Gameplay</span></h2>
            
            <p class="text-justify">This card game is generally played by using two stacks of 52 cards. It also uses two jokers. In the online version of the rummy game, the players who are pitted against one another are expected to make a proclamation. They have to choose and dump the cards from the two stacks of the cards that they are provided with. In a nutshell, in an online rummy game, the players have to make sequences. This brings us to the question: what is this sequence that the players must form to win the game? Speaking in general terms, a sequence can be formed through a collection of three or more consecutive cards, which can be both in the increase as well as in the decreasing order.</p> 
            <p class="text-justify">The rules of rummy declare that one can make both impure as well as the pure sequence in order to win a rummy game. In a pure sequence, the players are required to make a set of three or more cards, which must be arranged consecutively. Please remember that in the online version of the rummy game, the use of a joker or any wild card is strictly forbidden. Also, please remember that to win an online rummy game, the participant is expected to make at least one pure sequence. On the other hand, impure sequences of a rummy game use both wild cards and joker. To make an impure sequence, one is required to make a set of at least three or more cards, but one has to include at least one or more than one wildcard or joker. Although one can win a rummy game through impure sequences, one pure sequence needs to be placed in that game. Additionally, you are expected to have a precise understanding of the sets that are considered a must to win rummy games. In addition to the pure and the impure sequences that you require to win a rummy game, a participant is required to create proper rummy sets. So, what is this “set”? You must be aware that there are ranks in card games like rummy, and a set is a collection of at least three cards of the same rank, although it may be of different suits. In accordance with the rules of the rummy game, a set is allowed to have two similar cards of the same rank, especially since there are two stacks, each comprising 52 cards.</p>
            <h3 class="fw-bold sub-hd-block">Rummy Game Rules</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Let’s have a quick look at the rules of the rummy game. To begin with, the goal of a rummy game is to arrange the 13 cards in logical sets and sequences. The players have to make at least two sequences to win a game. But please remember that among these two sequences, at least one of them has to be a pure sequence, while the other one can be of any valid sequence or set. According to the rules of rummy, cards are graded from low to high, and the Aces, the Jacks, the Queens, and the Kings have maximum points, i.e., ten points. The rest of the cards are assigned with the same value as their number.</p>
            <ul class="list-block-all"> 
            <h3 class="fw-bold sub-hd-block" style="font-size: 17px;text-transform: inherit;">The Principal Rules of Rummy are</h3> 
            <p>1. A rummy game is generally played by 2 to 6 players. It can also be played with more than 6 players, but for that 2 decks of cards are allotted to the players.</p>
            <p>2. Each player is supposed to play with 13 cards.</p>
            <p>3. Players have to draw or discard cards to form legitimate sets and sequences.</p>
            <p>4. A, J, Q, and K have the highest value in Rummy.</p>
            <p>5. To win the game in the online mode, any player is expected to make at least one pure sequence.</p>
            </ul>

                                Is Rummy Legal to Play in India?

                              <p> Yes, playing rummy is totally legal in India. The Supreme Court of India has declared that rummy is more of a skill-based game and not a luck-based one. Therefore, it is rather protected by the Indian constitution. But few Indian states have their own laws, which forbid rummy.</p>
