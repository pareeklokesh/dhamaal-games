                        <p class="text-muted  text-justify">Historically speaking, Poker has been around for centuries now and has been one of the most popular card games. Existing documentation proves that this game was played in Germany at least in the sixteenth century, which later became popular in France, followed by the USA. The game of Poker evolved with time, and it is widely believed that during the American civil war, the seminal feature of drawing cards to improve one's hand was added.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted text-justify">Although private homes and poker rooms at casinos are still present, with digitization, Poker is now often played in online mode, which has its distinct advantages over the traditional methods. In today's world, poker enthusiasts usually prefer to play this game within one's physical comfort zone, and that is where online Poker comes in handy. Online Poker allows the players to play in their free time, participate on a global platform, and compete against the best of the poker players. Besides, online Poker comes with safe financial transactions. Depositing and withdrawing money is entirely safe and secure, an added bonus. The increasing popularity of online Poker is reflected in the growing number of online poker companies, like the Dhamaal App, which is offering amazing rewards for the poker players to earn. </p>

            <h2 class="sub_title"><span class="yellow">Poker</span> <span class="black"> Game Rules</span></h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Poker can be classified into four types. They are community card poker, straight Poker, draw poker, and stud poker. But there is some ground of commonalities among these, and these are:-</p> 
            <p><span class="font-600">1. Ranking-</span> All poker games revolve around a normative ranking of the poker hands, based on which winners are decided in a poker game.</p>
             <p class="text-justify"><span class="font-600">2. Bluffing-</span> Bluffing is another common characteristic in poker games. You can always bluff and pretend to have the upper hand in an ongoing match, thus attempting to intimidate your opponent and win the game.</p>
             <p class="text-justify"><span class="font-600">3. Bets-</span> Most forms of poker mandate some betting right at the beginning, which is often referred to as "blind." This "blind" can both be a small and a big one, thus determining the betting amount. </p>
             <p class="text-justify"><span class="font-600">4. Poker dealer-</span> In both online and offline Poker, it is the dealer who decides the unfolding of the game. In most cases, this dealer is not one of the players but is the one who lets the players place the bet.</p>
             <p class="text-justify">Additionally, there are three major types of betting on Poker. They are pot-limit, fixed limit, and no-limit Poker. While pot-limit Poker doesn't allow the players to bet more than the total size of the whole pot, one can bet up to the fixed amount in fixed limit poker. Additionally, in no-limit Poker, the players can bet all the chips, but it has to be their betting turn.</p>
             <p class="text-justify">Poker is a game of skill, and during the game, one can try to gauge the potential of the opponents' cards and bet accordingly. It requires excellent control over one's body language and flawless observation power. The game needs strategies to win, and once the game begins, the players have the options to call, raise, fold, or check.</p>
            <h3 class="fw-bold sub-hd-block">Hand Taking Rules in Poker</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Poker hands fall into one of ten categories. The highest is a royal flush, followed by a straight flush, then four of a kind, a full house, a flush, a straight, three of a kind, two pairs, one pair, and finally a high card. This is the same for all the main poker variations, including Texas.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Like any card game, Poker also has its rules and guidelines that should be followed during any match. One of such rules is poker hands, which determines the strength of cards, based on which the winner is ascertained. These rules of Poker are often referred to as poker hands, and any variation of, including Texas Hold'em Poker, follows this. Poker hands are basically of ten types. They are:</p>

            <p class="text-justify"><span class="font-600">1. Royal Flush -</span> A royal flush has the highest grade. It is formed with the rarest combination of Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 10, and all of them should be from the same suit. The probability of making a royal flush is as low as 1/6,49,737.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"><span class="font-600">2. Straight Flush -</span> This forms the second-highest grade. In this, the players are expected to form a sequence using five cards in a row, and all of them have to be in the same suit.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify"><span class="font-600">3. Four of a kind -</span> For this grade, the players are required to make a sequence using the same card, and each of them should be in the four suits.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"><span class="font-600">4. Full house -</span> A player has to combine a pair and three of any kind in a full house, but this has to be in the same hand.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"><span class="font-600">5. Flush- </span>A flush is another grade used in Poker. This requires the players to form five cards in a suit. But there is no need to follow a strict numerical order.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"><span class="font-600">6. Straight-</span> Little different from flush, a straight sequence of five cards have to follow numerical order but maybe in a different order. </p>
            <p><span class="font-600">7. Three of a kind-</span> It is a combination of three paired and two non-paired cards. </p>
            <p><span class="font-600">8. Two pairs-</span> This poker hand has two different pairs of cards in one hand.</p>
            <p><span class="font-600">9. One pair-</span> It has a pair of the same card</p>
            <p><span class="font-600">10. High card-</span> This refers to a situation of no matching cards and has the lowest grade in a poker game.</p>

                               Is Poker Legal in India? 
                                      </div>

                           <p class="text-justify"> Although the topic of legality in the context of Poker has been subject to speculations for quite some time now, you can rest assured that it is entirely legal in India. There have been a couple of supreme court judgments in this matter. They have noted that Poker involves skill and is, therefore, to be considered as a skill-based game. Now, the Indian constitution safeguards skills, which is part of the fundamental right, and therefore, any skill-based game can't be prohibited. Recently both the High Court of Calcutta and the High Court of Karnataka have also reiterated the same opinion. Therefore, jurists opine that even online Poker can not be declared to be illegal in India.</p>

                                 <p class="text-justify">  In simple words, Poker is a viral variant of a card game, which has been played for centuries now. It is mostly played with a standard deck of 52 cards. This intense game requires many skills, and one needs to strategize before playing it. Poker involves active betting and bluffing. Bets are often made with 'chips', which are a kind of small plastic plate. Poker requires players to play according to the value of their poker hands, which is the gradation system of the game, which determines the winner.</p>

Besides, apart from the dealer button, both of them involve small blind and big blind.</p>
                                   <p class="text-justify">Certain games use a blinds system about the betting order. Otherwise, there are other kinds of poker games that follow the antes system. While in the blinds system, the betting begins with the participant, who sits to the left of the big blind, every player at the table is mandated to place a bet in the antes system. After placing the chance, you have a couple of options to follow, like call, raise, fold or check.</p>
