             <p>4. Keep your tokens all over the board, and never line them up very close. This shall enable you to capture more tokens of your opponents and save those tokens which are near the finishing line.</p>
             <p>5. Plan accordingly. Have a good understanding of your opponent's gaming strategies. If you wish to win the game, try not to waste any chance at the dice.</p>

                        <p> In a ludo game, one has to play with four tokens. Players compete against one another and have to take all four tokens up to the finishing line. The game is played with the help of dice, and the highest value, "6," begins the journey of a token. A "6" also gives a second chance to the player, and they can use both the values of the dice numbers. One can also capture other's tokens by landing one's tokens on somebody else's. Additionally, you can use two tokens to form a dyad which can block any single token of the opponents.</p>

                                <p>  In Ludo, two to four players can play at a time. The rules of the game are rather simple. There is no specific schema of the scores that are to be followed. Players are expected to compete against one another, and ideally, each player has to play with four tokens, which they race against one other, and they have to race the tokens up to the finishing line. The one who is the first player to make all the tokens to the home is declared to be the winner.</p>

                                    <p>A ludo game requires the use of four tokens. Players battle against one another to get all four tokens to the finish line first. The ludo game is played with the aid of dice, with the highest value, "6," initiating a token's trip. A "6" also offers the player a second opportunity, and they can utilize the cumulative value of both the dice. You may also capture other people's tokens by landing yours on theirs. Additionally, you can also build a dyad by combining two tokens that can block any single opponent's token. The player who is the first to get all four tokens to the winning line wins the whole game.</p>
